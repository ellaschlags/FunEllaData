#  Fun Ella Data

Welcome to the **Fun Ella Data** repo! This is where I collect data about my daily habits, routines, and activities, and analyze them to discover interesting trends and insights about my life. 🚀

## 📊 What's Inside?

This repository is filled with notebooks that dive into my personal data, colouring everything from sleep patterns to house-leaving habits. It's a fun way to explore the hidden stories in numbers!

### Examples Include
- **🏃‍♂️ House-Leaving Time Patterns**: How regular is my routine when leaving the house? Is there any trend during the week?
- **🌙 Bedtime Predictions**: Can I predict my bedtimes based on previous data, and how consistent are my sleeping habits?

By analyzing my personal data, I hope to:

- Identify patterns and make better decisions.
- Improve my routines and habits.
